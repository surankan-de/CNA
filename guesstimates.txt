##guesstimate of customer base of used electronics market in india

lets say total population of india is 140 cr
out of them 25% are the earning members = 35 CR
out of which 
 10 % belong to upper class 3.5 Cr
 20 % upper middle class 7 Cr
 30 % middle class 10.5 Cr
 40 % poor class 14 Cr

in upper class only 10% prefers to buy used electronics =0.35 Cr
in upper middle class 30% prefer to buy used electronics = 2.1 Cr
in middle class 50% prefers to buy used electronics = 5.25 Cr
in poor class 70 % people prefers to buy used electonics = 9.8 Cr

total market of people who are willing to buy used electronics in  india = 17.5Cr



####guesstimate of profit(hypothetical)

lets say we sell one product of cost(rs 10) and production cost 100
lets say we have stock of 10 products (10 people generally buy from the company since it has strong reputation)
so total cost = 200

now since generally the profit of 30-50 percent is assumed lets say since the price is high the price per good is 30 per good(##market price is 27)
since customer comes less lets say 6 people buy this product then total revenue = 180 which is less than 200 so company will be in loss

if we reduce the price to the market price then lets say instead of 6 ,8 people come and buy and costs are being managed to rebe reduced by 5 %then total revenue is 216 where as cost is 195 thus we get profit

this case is hypothetical as many things are assumed here but we need some more clarifying questions to get enough data and solve this problem
